Hi, call me Odilon or Dino, whatever... ðŸ‘‹.
I'm a Back-end developer at @Taghos Tecnologia (remote position).

I'm a developer focused on delivering high quality Back-end solutions.
My software development experience includes, but is not limited to, REST API's, GraphQL in Node.js and its ecosystem.
I enjoy exploring the features of modern tools, which lead development to new and flexible solutions.

- ðŸ¦– Curiosity: They call me "Dino" because I live in Acre, and believe me, Acre exists.
